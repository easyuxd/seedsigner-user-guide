# Create a new seed

> Generate a new BIP-39 seed phrase using camera entropy, dice rolls, or manual word selection.

SeedSigner offers three ways to create a brand-new seed phrase. Each method captures physical entropy (randomness from the real world) so that your private key is unpredictable and secure.

## Choose your method

| Method | How it works | Rolls / steps | Best for |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Camera** | Captures randomness from a photograph | 1 photo | Quick seed creation |
| **Dice** | Converts physical dice rolls into a seed | 50 (12-word) or 99 (24-word) | Maximum provable randomness |
| **Calculate final word** | You supply 11 or 23 words; SeedSigner computes the checksum word | Manual entry + entropy | Users who select their own words |

> **Tip:** A 24-word seed provides more entropy than a 12-word seed. For long-term cold storage, 24 words is recommended. For multi-signature setups, 12-word seeds per key can be sufficient.

## Method 1: Camera-based seed generation

This method uses environmental entropy captured by the camera — pixel data, preview frames, the Pi's serial number, and the elapsed uptime in milliseconds are all mixed together.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools**.

2. Select **New Seed** (camera icon).

3. Point the camera at a random, moving scene (trees, clouds, traffic). Press any key to capture.

4. Review the captured image. Push the joystick **left** to retake, or **right** to accept.

5. Choose **12 words** or **24 words**.

6. Read the security warning and press **I Understand**.

7. **Write down every word** in exact order. Words display four at a time. Double-check each one.

8. Complete the **backup verification** quiz. SeedSigner asks you to confirm specific words to prove your written backup is correct.

> **Warning:** If you write even one word incorrectly, you could permanently lose access to your Bitcoin. Never skip the verification step. If you see an error, see [Error messages](/troubleshooting/error-messages.md) for help.

## Method 2: Dice-based seed generation

Physical dice produce true randomness that cannot be influenced by software bugs or hardware backdoors. This is the most trust-minimized method.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools**.
2. Select **New Seed** (dice icon).

3. Choose your seed length:
   - **12 words** = 50 dice rolls
   - **24 words** = 99 dice rolls

4. Roll a standard six-sided die. On the screen, press the **joystick** in the direction of the number you rolled (1--6). Repeat for every roll.

5. A progress bar shows how many rolls remain.

6. Read the security warning and press **I Understand**.
7. Write down all seed words and complete the backup verification.

> **Tip:** Use a casino-grade die for the best randomness. Roll on a flat, hard surface.

## Method 3: Calculate the 12th or 24th word

If you want to choose your own words from the BIP-39 word list, this method lets you enter 11 or 23 words and then computes a valid final checksum word.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools** → **Calc 12th/24th word**.

   ![Calc method](../images/SeedGenerateCalcMethodView.png)

2. Choose **12 words** or **24 words**.

   ![Calc seed length](../images/SeedMnemonicLengthCalcView.png)

3. Enter each word using the on-screen keyboard:
   - **Key A** — move up in the suggestion list
   - **Key C** — move down in the suggestion list
   - **Key B** — select the highlighted word
   - Type the first 2--3 letters and pick from suggestions for speed.

4. After entering all words, choose how to generate entropy for the final word:

   ![Finalize prompt](../images/ToolsCalcFinalWordFinalizePromptView.png)

   - **Coin flips** — Flip a physical coin 7 times; enter heads (1) or tails (0) for each.
   - **Word selection** — Pick any word from the BIP-39 list as your entropy source.
   - **Zeros** — Uses a 7-bit string of zeros (simplest, still valid).

5. SeedSigner displays the calculated final word along with the derivation details.

6. Your complete seed phrase is now ready for backup and use.

> **Technical note:** The final word in any BIP-39 seed phrase contains both entropy bits and a checksum. The checksum detects transcription errors and proves the phrase is mathematically valid.

## What to do next

After creating your seed, SeedSigner loads it into memory. You can now:

- [Export your public key (xpub)](/using-seedsigner/export-xpub.md) to set up a watch-only wallet
- [Back up your seed as a SeedQR](/using-seedsigner/seedqr-backup.md) for fast future loading
- [Sign a transaction](/using-seedsigner/sign-transaction.md) if your wallet is already configured
