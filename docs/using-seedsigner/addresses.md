# Explore addresses

> Browse and verify the receiving and change addresses derived from your loaded seed.

SeedSigner includes a built-in address explorer that lets you verify that an address shown by your coordinator actually belongs to your wallet.

## Before you begin

You need a seed [loaded into SeedSigner](/using-seedsigner/load-seed.md).

## Open the address explorer

1. From the main menu, select **Seeds** → choose your loaded seed → **Address Explorer**.

2. Choose a **script type** (address format):
   - **Native SegWit** (bc1q...) — recommended, lowest fees
   - **Nested SegWit** (3...) — compatible with older wallets
   - **Taproot** (bc1p...) — advanced privacy features

## View receiving addresses

Receiving addresses are the ones you share with others to accept payments.

1. Select **Receive addresses**.

2. Browse the paginated list (10 addresses per page). Use the joystick to scroll.

3. Select any address to display its QR code for sharing.

> **Tip:** Use a fresh receiving address for each transaction. Reusing addresses reduces your privacy because it links multiple payments together on the public blockchain.

## View change addresses

Change addresses receive the leftover funds from a transaction. Your wallet manages these automatically — you typically do not need to share or manually use them.

1. Select **Change addresses** instead of Receive.

2. Browse and select addresses the same way as receiving addresses.

## Why verify addresses?

If malware on your computer compromises your coordinator wallet, it could display a fake receiving address that sends your Bitcoin to an attacker. By checking the address on SeedSigner's air-gapped screen — which cannot be tampered with remotely — you confirm the address truly belongs to your wallet.

Make it a habit to verify new receiving addresses on SeedSigner before sharing them, especially for large amounts.
